# ðŸ¤– CodeReview : An AI-Powered Code Review Web Application

This project is a full-stack web application designed to help developers improve their code quality. It uses an AI model on the backend to provide constructive code reviews, which are then displayed on a user-friendly frontend interface. This application demonstrates proficiency in modern web development practices, including full-stack architecture, API integration, and user interface design.

## âœ¨ Features

    - User Authentication: Secure signup and login functionality to manage user access to the application.

    - Review History: Users can view a complete history of their past code reviews, with the ability to revisit and analyze previous feedback.

    - Customizable AI-Powered Feedback: The backend leverages the Google Gemini API to act as a senior code reviewer. You can choose a specific review focus, such as General, Security, Performance, or Code Quality, to get tailored feedback.

    - Real-time Code Review: Users can paste code into an editor and receive instant feedback from the AI.

    - Syntax Highlighting: The code editor and the review output both feature syntax highlighting for enhanced readability.

    - Responsive UI: The interface is built with React and CSS to provide a clean and responsive experience.

    - Modular Backend: The backend is organized into separate files for services, controllers, and routes, following a clean architecture pattern.
